Hi, I'm Marcel Prakash 👋
👨‍💻 3rd Year Software Engineering Student | Backend & Full-Stack Developer

I'm a passionate 3rd-year Software Engineering student at Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology, focused on building robust, scalable applications from the network layer up to the user interface. I love tackling complex backend challenges and delivering projects with a strong emphasis on aesthetic appeal and accessibility.

🚀 Current Focus & Key Projects

My current work centers around two major engineering challenges:
1. HTTP Web Server

A foundational project where I am diving deep into networking and operating system concepts.

    Challenge: Implementing core HTTP request handling, routing, and concurrent client connections without relying on high-level frameworks.

    Goal: To achieve a better understanding of how the web fundamentally works, focusing on performance and reliability.

    Tech Focus: Python (for TCP Socket Listeners)

2. MEVN Stack Event Finder App

A full-stack application designed to aggregate event data using modern web technologies.

    Stack: MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node.js)

    Features: Utilizes a custom web scraper to gather real-time event data, stores it in MongoDB, and serves a dynamic, accessible Vue frontend.

    Focus: CRUD functionality, data modeling, cross-referencing for information retrieval, and building aesthetically appealing user interfaces.
